# What is Givestation ?

A multi-chain Give-To-Earn grant protocol where contributors get rewarded for funding ideas, startups, and projects in web3.

# Why WEB3?

Web3 is the internet owned by the everyone including builders, creators, founders, and users.  

## What are we trying to solve?
The traditional fundraising community is too centralized and while the donors are being screwed for donating and trusting a project/idea, they end up not seeing the impact of their contributions. 
There is almost no room for transparency by default. This is a huge challenge for every of traditional crowdfunding ecosystem, and that is what we are here to fix.

### How does it work
To facilitate token donations and contributions from donors of the Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance smart chain and Gnosis, and other blockchain community towards builders and project owners, the GiveStation ecosystem rely upon the straightforwardness blockchain has provided.
GiveStation’s rationale is encoded into smart contracts and other web3 innovations and that is why it requires next to no confide in any individual or communites to function.  
The platform is not limited to developers and web programmers alone as we have made the platform available for everybody as long as they need grants to bring their ideas into reality. 
Any user can visit the platform, pick any idea or project they believe in, contribute directly to this life changing projects and in doing so, they get rewarded in GP.

### `Our Mission`

Our mission is torevolutionize incentives, instill transparency, reward and protect the donors while making sure that the funds allocated to this founders and teams are used in the right way without relying on the same old centralized entities.
